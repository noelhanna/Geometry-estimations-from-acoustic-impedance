# Geometry-estimations-from-acoustic-impedance
Matlab fitting algorithm to estimate vocal tract area functions from acoustic impedance spectra

Uses simplified version of the repository Vocal-tract-acoustic-impedance-simulations
- Vocal_Tract_test_GENERAL.m

Uses a GUI to select an impedance measurement, then makes a fit based on impedance magnitude
- User can select 1-10 VT cylinders for a closed glottis measurement
- For open 

## Significant contributions
- Anne Rodriguez

### Not currently working
- Can choose to fit based on impedance magnitude, phase or a combination of both
